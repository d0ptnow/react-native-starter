# What's React-Native Starter? (Work in progress)
React-Native Starter is a boilerplate for a a simple auth flow I use daily. 
- Parse-Server as auth backend and the Parse JS SDK for connecting to it (`/services/parseService.js`)
- Redux for state management
- Redux saga for side-effects
- `react-native-i18n` for internationalization
- NavigationExperimental for routing
